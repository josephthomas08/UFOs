# UFOs

Using Javascript , bootstrap, css, html  to develop a UFO sightings, recording and finding page.

# Overview
As a personal project of Dana we are assisting Dana to develop a HTML  project of quality with help of Javascript, css, bootstrap. The html page will be built in such a way that it will pull out information from Javascript data file using filters on the html page. We plan to provide five (5) filters which will filter data based on date, city, state, country and shape (UFO).


The various HTML page results as filtered and documented are provided as requested.

The clients on visiting our html webpage will be welcomed with clear purpose of the html page of what we want to achive and provide as part of this initial UFOs sightings webpage.
The five filters of date, city, state, country and shape will help our clients to see the UFOs of different shape seen in differents parts of country.
All the five filters can be applied for focussed view of clients.


## Deliverable 1 


### 1.1. The list element that creates the button is removed, and there are five list elements for filtering in the index.html file. 

The filter button initially coded has been removed and replaced with five filters for date, city, state, country and shape of UFOs sighted in different parts of USA.

### 1.3. The updateFilters() function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. 

Console.log code is used to provide the effective results of update filters in app.js file.

## Deliverable 2


# Summary
The web page created with Javascript, HTML, bootstrap, css has come out aesthatically pretty well for start and it looks clean and allows the vistitors to sift through various data based on date, city, state, country and shapes. Collective filtering makes it more informative for UFOs enthusiast. 

One major drawback in the data anlayis field is always limited data availability. Here too provision of more data with additional filter of how many people sighted the UFOs will add more authenticty and confirmation.

#### The two main recommendation which comes to my mind in order to improve the html page will be :
#### 1. Create portal for collection of more data for UFOs sightings including provision for multiple people affirming to the sighting of same sightings.
#### 2. Develop sites to incorporate images as part of sightings, build additional filters for adding the images and Encourage UFOs entusiaist to add images in the data collection portal.
